Sample API calls for the Data Pusher Django application can be found in this directory. These sample programmes show you how to use the different API endpoints.

I'm using the Django REST framework views to access the endpoint, and I'm using Postman to send requests with the incoming_data.json request. Every request in Postman is functioning properly. For simpler reference and administration, I am utilising the Django REST framework interface, though.
